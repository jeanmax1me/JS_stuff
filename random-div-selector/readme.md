small project for an upwork client, 
instructions were: 

"We need you to use Javascript to select a random DIV from the current scroll view the user is seeing.

For example, if the user has scrolled to the bottom of the page, only one of the DIVs at the bottom of the page would be randomly selected.

Then we need you to add a CSS class to this randomly selected DIV. It will hold this class for a few seconds. Then it would select another randomly selected DIV.

Everything will be Javascript and CSS. No backend language."
